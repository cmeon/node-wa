node-wa
=======

Node.js whatsapp access

Loosely based on the WhatsAPI and Wazapp projects that you can find on github.

Appears to work in all versions of Node from 0.2 to 0.8.  

I don't know much about building node modules properly, so hopefully if anyone else finds this useful, they can
clean up some of the mess.  

Good luck and enjoy.
